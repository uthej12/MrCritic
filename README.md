# MrCritic

This is a simple website created by me to understand and practice web development. MrCritic is meant to be a website that provides information on all the movies and TV shows.

MrCritic was designed tobe a minimalistic and elegant.This was acchived by the use of Bootstrap for the visually appealing looks and jquery for the animations.

MrCritic has been developed to have a lot of features such as it has information of all the upcoming and popular movies displayed on the home page. A user can find the information about a respective movie by either searching or browsing through the top lists present in the application. The website is also able to provide information about the artists in the movie or TV show as well. 

There is a standard account system which allows users to register on the website and create favorite lists, comment on movies and get relavent recomendations on their feed
